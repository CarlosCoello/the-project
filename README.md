# TheProject

So here we go :)

The project will be an ecommerce

So lets give the user a great experience when utilizing our web app

A great developer is alway curious in trying some code out and learning from that experience.

# angular cli
the boilerplate of the app was built with the angular cli like so: ng new the-project --style=scss. So --style=scss is a flag that lets angular cli know that we want scss to be wired up when creating the boilerplate.

# git cloning
once you git clone the app in your local environment go ahead and the run the following command in your terminal: npm install, ng serve

npm install: installs all the package.json depencies and devdepencies
ng serve: runs the app for local development

# common folder
the common folder stores files that will be used across the web app hence the name common
